## Introduction

    This project contains models designed to make various prediction including:
        - Breast cancer
        - House prices
        - loan status
        - Used phone prices
        - Visa approvals
### Note:
The project is in phases; as and when a model is ready, it will be uploaded

## 1. Breast cancer

    Research Hypothesis: This study hypothesizes that there are significant associations between the diagnostic characteristics of patients, including age, menopause status, tumor size, presence of invasive nodes, affected breast, metastasis status, breast quadrant, history of breast conditions, and their breast cancer diagnosis result. Data Collection and Description:The dataset of 213 patient observations was obtained from the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital cancer registry over 24 months (January 2019–August 2021). The data includes eleven features: year of diagnosis, age, menopause status, tumor size in cm, number of invasive nodes, breast (left or right) affected, metastasis (yes or no), quadrant of the breast affected, history of breast disease, and diagnosis result (benign or malignant).Notable Findings:Upon preliminary examination, the data shows variations in diagnosis results across different patient features. A noticeable trend is the higher prevalence of malignant results among patients with larger tumor sizes and the presence of invasive nodes. Additionally, postmenopausal women seem to have a higher rate of malignant diagnoses.Interpretation and Usage:The data can be analyzed using statistical and machine learning techniques to determine the strength and significance of associations between patient characteristics and breast cancer diagnosis. This can contribute to predictive modeling for the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.However, the interpretation must consider potential limitations, such as missing data or bias in data collection. Furthermore, the data reflects patients from a single hospital, limiting the generalizability of the findings to wider populations.The data could be valuable for healthcare professionals, researchers, or policymakers interested in understanding breast cancer diagnosis factors and improving healthcare strategies for breast cancer. It could also be used in patient education about risk factors associated with breast cancer.

## 2. House pricing

    In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, amenities, and other relevant factors. We will use a dataset containing historical housing data, including features and corresponding sale prices, to train and evaluate the model.

## 3. Loan status

    In this Loan Status Prediction dataset, we have the data of applicants who previously applied for the loan based on the property which is a Property Loan. The bank will decide whether to give a loan to the applicant based on some factors such as Applicant Income, Loan Amount, previous Credit History, Co-applicant Income, etc… Our goal is to build a Machine Learning Model to predict the loan to be approved or to be rejected for an applicant.

## 4. Used phone price

    Buying and selling used phones and tablets used to be something that happened on a handful of online marketplace sites. But the used and refurbished device market has grown considerably over the past decade, and a new IDC (International Data Corporation) forecast predicts that the used phone market would be worth $52.7bn by 2023 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2018 to 2023. This growth can be attributed to an uptick in demand for used phones and tablets that offer considerable savings compared with new models.

## 5. Visa approval

    Business communities in the United States are facing high demand for human resources, but one of the constant challenges is identifying and attracting the right talent, which is perhaps the most important element in remaining competitive. Companies in the United States look for hard-working, talented, and qualified individuals both locally as well as abroad.
